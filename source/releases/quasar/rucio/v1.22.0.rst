v1.22.0
------------

What’s new
~~~~~~~~~~

Rucio authentication and authorization mechanism was extended to support (JWT) tokens 
using Open ID Connect protocol (following `the OAuth 2.0 specifications <https://oauth.net/2/>`_). 
The `implementation <https://github.com/gumond/rucio/tree/feature-2612-OIDC-AuthZN-base-next>`_)is based 
on `pyoidc <https://github.com/OpenIDC/pyoidc>`_ (OIDC `certified <https://openid.net/developers/certified/>`_) library and it follows the WLCG 
specifications documented `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hnsPWf9C7ODVXZ7JehsSEiEsQwf5UmqLfTwVDhuqHzk/edit#>`_ (subject to certain changes as these specifications 
are currently still being developed). 

To perform operations with Rucio a user can now newly log in via 
an `authorization code grant <https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/>`_ mechanism. 
This has been made possible via Rucio WebUI, and Rucio command line interface (CLI). 3 CLI login strategies were 
implemented to serve various use cases.  

Rucio REST API can also accept JWT tokens issued by Identity Providers out of the Rucio 
authorization code grant flow. Such JWT tokens can serve as means of authentication 
and authorization if they contain the required minimal scope and audience in their 
claims, are valid and their identity is known to Rucio. In order to allow permission 
control downstream (Rucio → FTS3) Rucio implemented also an internal mechanism using 
token exchange and token refresh grants. 

Rucio user pre-provisioning (via new Rucio SCIM client) was 
`implemented <https://github.com/rucio/probes/pull/11>`_ as a ‘Rucio probe’ script. 
In order to manage token life-cycle, a new Rucio daemon was implemented taking care of 
token deletion, token refresh and clean-up of expired authentication OIDC sessions. 
Rucio DB schema was extended to contain: necessary new columns in the ‘tokens’ table 
and a new table ‘oauth_requests’ to handle OIDC authentication sessions.  

First functional tests of a third party copy were performed (Rucio → FTS3 → dCache) 
and a new `Rucio testbed instance <https://90.147.102.221/ui/>`_ is being setup.
