Rucio
==============

.. contents:: Table of Contents

**Rucio** is a project that provides services and associated libraries for allowing 
scientific collaborations to manage large volumes of data spread across facilities at 
multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio has been developed by the `ATLAS experiment <https://atlas.cern/>`_.

Rucio offers advanced features, is highly scalable, and modular. 
It is a data management solution that could cover the needs of different communities in the 
scientific domain (e.g., HEP, astronomy, biology).

Through the XDC project new features are added like the **adoption of a token based 
approach to authentication & authorisation for data management with Rucio**.
