vXDC-2
------------

Whatâ€™s new
~~~~~~~~~~

Upstream corresponding version: v. 6.1.3

**Highlights**

- dCacheView: uses inotify-over-SSE to keep page up-to-date.
- storage-events: 

  - added missing events in inotify-over-SSE.
  - performance and robustness improvements for inotify-over-SSE 

- Optional TLS for p2p transfers
- Zone-aware cell messaging
- New serialization format


**Incompatibilities**

- Starting release 6.1 the **BerkeleyDBMetaDataRepository** is the default metadata 
  repository for the pools. Sites that was not explicitly specifying **pool.plugins.meta**
  property have to set the old default value: **pool.plugins.meta=org.dcache.pool.repository.meta.file.FileMetaDataRepository**

- Pool in 6.1.x are not compatible with older dcap doors. However, new dcap doors can 
  operate with existing pools.
