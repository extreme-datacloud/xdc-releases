- Important Functionalities:

  - IAM authentication
  - Display user's deployments
  - Display deployment details, template and log
  - Delete deployment
  - Create new deployment

- New features:

  - allowed_group in template metadata can be used to control the access to the templates
    monitoring information displayed for each resource provider service
  - Vault integration: users can manage their credentials for services that are not 
    integrated with INDIGO IAM storing them in Vault

    - new parameters added in the configuration to enable the Vault integration (VAUL_URL, VAULT_ROLE, VAULT_OIDC_AUDIENCE)
  
  - deployment creation timeout can be set from the Advanced tab panel when configuring 
    the deployment

- Improvements

  - Improved deployment outputs view
  - Improved SLA view (menu and page renamed in "Resource Providers")

- Bug fixed:

  - Parameters are now correctly set in the Orchestrator POST request (e.g. keepLastAttempt, maxProvidersRetry)
