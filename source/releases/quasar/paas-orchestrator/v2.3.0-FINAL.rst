List of RfCs
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New features:
   * Added timeout for deployment creation/update. The following new parameters can be used for the REST API call to /deployment (POST/PUT):
      * timeoutMins: overall timeout for the deployment creation/update;
      * providerTimeoutMins: timeout for the deployment creation/update on single provider.
   * Added credentials management for providers not integrated with IAM
      * the credentials are automatically retrieved from Vault

* Improvements
      * Updated A4C Tosca Parser library (v2.1.0-DEEP-1.2.1) that fixes problem with block 
   device attachment.
      * Updated IM Java Client library (v0.4.14).
      * Now users can list only their own deployments. Only users belonging to a specific 
   IAM group (configured in the mandatory field "admingroup") can list all the deployments and their details.
      * Improved retry strategy for Marathon deployments


* Bug fixed:
    * Fixed OnedataSpace resource management
    * Fixed configuration (application.properties)
